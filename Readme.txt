To start and run this application you only need to start the BasicOgreFramework solution and compile it without debugging.
We haven't tested it outside Windows but it will probably not work.
There has been a problem with different versions of visual studio leading to a problem with the NxOgre compilation and it might need to be recompiled. The first thing you may try to do is to exchange the NxOgreOGRE3D.lib file in simengines-g2-code\BasicOgreFramework\NXOgre\sdk, for the file in BasicOgreFramework\Fix for NXOgre. If this does not solve the problem, contact us.
If any problems should occur contact us at erucarno@gmail.com.
